bpm (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

    * Added Bash auto-completion for `bpm` binary.
    * Changed `version` command is now able to show current "dev" version, while application is located within a git repository
    * Changed Improved `bin/build-version` helper. It's now able to obtain "dev" version, when current commit does match that of the git tag's commit.
    * Changed Support for `NO_COLOR` environment variable. If set, then output will remove ANSI colour codes.
    * Fixed ANSI not entirely removed in `output_helpers::resolve_ansi` method
